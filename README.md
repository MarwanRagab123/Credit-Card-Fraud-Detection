# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud. With the increasing rate of fraudulent transactions, it is crucial to implement efficient detection systems to protect consumers and financial institutions.

The project leverages various machine learning algorithms, particularly Logistic Regression, to analyze transaction data and identify suspicious activities. By utilizing techniques such as data preprocessing, oversampling, and model evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix), we ensure the model's effectiveness in accurately classifying legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

### Objectives:

- **Data Collection:** Gather a comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions, including both fraudulent and non-fraudulent examples.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, categorical variables, and class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
- **Model Development:** Train and evaluate various machine learning models, focusing on their performance metrics to determine the most effective approach.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the model's accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix to ensure it meets the required standards for practical implementation.

### Key Features:

- Implementation of Logistic Regression for fraud detection.
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Visualizations of precision-recall curves to identify optimal thresholds.
- User-friendly interface for easy integration and usage.
